# Designing Websites - A Statistical Approach
In this report I will be working through the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce company. The test evaluates the success of a new webpage in relation to the companies existing page - should the company adopt the new design or not?

Through the use of various statistical techniques which include probability, hypothesis testing and logistic regression I utilise Python to come to a definitive conclusion.

I hope you enjoy the report!
